--make sure your ExchangeTriggers folder has the following start of line filter set:
--+++
--set the following perl regex in the echoExchange_Buy trigger:
--^\+{3} Exchange will buy (\d+) tons at (\d+)(.+) \+{3}
-----[ lua code ]-----
--puts the buying price (matches[3]) into exchange window
--matches[4] contains the 'ig/ton' that usually follows a buying price
--matches[2] is the amount they're willing to purchase, but this should always be 75 tons?
--maybe do some multiplication to get actual price for a 75 ton container?
